/*
-- EXERCISE 1 - LEVEL 1 - SPRINT 3
Your task is to design and create a table called "credit_card" that stores crucial details about credit cards. 
The new table must be able to uniquely identify each card and establish an appropriate relationship with the other two tables ("transaction" and "company"). After creating the table, you will need to insert the information from the document named "dades_introduir_credit". 
Remember to display the diagram and provide a brief description of it.
